      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm primarily a musician, but currently make money as a computer repair technician and saleman. I'm learning to code because a hashtag told me to.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Andover, Massachusetts</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>painting, running, hiking, acting</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>touring the world, playing music and acting in movies</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always loved to figure out why things work in the way that they do. If nothing else I'm doing this to gain an understanding of something that I know nothing about, not necessarily to become a developer</p>
